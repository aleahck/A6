Project: Texas Hold'em

Compiling & Running: To compile the game, type in 'cs3110 compile play.ml' in the directory containing the game files. To run the game, type in 'cs3110 run play.ml'.

Playing the Game: After running the game, the welcome message will appear. Make sure you scroll up if your terminal screen isn't large enough to fully appreciate the art! The welcome message will include instructions on how to play, which you can access again at any point in the game by entering 'rules' as a command.

Each turn, the game will print out the board (the list of cards that everyone can see), the current cumulative bet of the hand, and the cumulative pot of the hand, as well as your own stake (how much money you have), the cards you are dealt, and how much it will cost you to call (if calling will cost you 0, the game instead prints "You can check"). During your turn, you can call, raise by a number, fold, or check.

After each turn, the AI will go (the AI's move is shown in a box with the text "AI /does some move/"), and the game will print out again, prompting you for input.
